# Research Paper Implementation

In this directory, Research Paper Implementation will be done.<br>
Here is the order that I completed; the order does not necessarily follow the chronological order of the model development.<br>
I believe the below are the ***MUST*** to learn to start with NLP.<br>
If anyone has any suggestions, please feel free to tell me! :)

- After going through Single Layer Perceptron, I realized that reading a research paper line by line is quite ineffective.<br>Therefore, I have decided to go through only the equations and their explanations and conclusions.


1. Attention Is All You Need (Transformer) ☑️
2. Single Layer Perceptron ☑️
3. Back-Propagation & Multilayer Perceptron ☑️
4. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) & Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) <<<< On Going >>>>
5. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
6. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
7. Batch Normalization
8. The graph neural network model (GNN)
