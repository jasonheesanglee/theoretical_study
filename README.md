# Theoretical Study

After continuing my studies in the field of AI, I realized that my knowledge needs to be improved to better understand the contents I am dealing with.<br>
Therefore, I decided to study from the very beginning.<br>
Here is the list of the contents I will study.<br>
<sub>The list can be updated and refined as I progress through the studies.</sub>

1. Mathematics
2. Transformers (Logic & Implementation)
3. BERT
4. GPT
5. Deep Research in Evaluation Metrics (what do they even mean and how to construct them)
6. LLM
